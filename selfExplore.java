//HashSet is a collection of unique elements, can store nul, faster then TreeSet,
//TreeSet stores unique emements in sorterd order, more methods, 
//LinkedHashSet is like HashSet but it remembers the order elemets are added, can store null,

//Set vs List

//Set can't have duplicates, searching for an element in a HashSet is faster than searching for an element in an ArrayList, Set is not guaranteed to maintain order
//List can have duplicates, elements to an ArrayList is faster than adding elements to a HashSet,

//key characteristics
//HashSet doesn’t keep order of elements
//LinkedHashSet keeps order of elements as added
//TreeSet orders  elements according to added Comparator, else orders in ascending order
